Here is the plan to implement the dedicated store management page:
   1. Create a new route and page at /dashboard/stores that lists all stores and links to an edit page
      for each.
   2. Create a new route and page at /dashboard/stores/new for adding a new store.
   3. Create the dynamic route and page at /dashboard/stores/[id] for editing or deleting a specific
      store.
   4. Add a link to the new "Stores" page in the main sidebar navigation for easy access.
